This is a simple Java/Processing application for collecting experimental data.

The experiment participant can play a sound and then rate on a discreet scale (currently one to seven).

In the current setup, there are different blocks of stimuli and the order of those blocks as well as the order of stimuli within the blocks are randomized.
